This project is called BEIGHT. It is a workout app that only focuses on body weight exercises, (the combination of the words 'body' and 'weight' make 'beight'). I want to have the bare bones set up. So far, I have programmed the Push-up movement, as seen in the graphic above.

### More about the product:

<be>

BEIGHT is an app that uses computer vision to track human workouts, as well as set workout plans and calendars, acting as an interactive coach by using computer vision to track the rep, counts as well as make sure the posture of each rep is done correctly, as well as a simple fitness tracker. It will consist of a calendar that shows your upcoming workouts, you can choose between different fitness plans (6,8,12 week plans), and you can choose to focus on a specific body part, like abs focused workout plan, meaning the plan will consist of all the routine workouts, but focus more on the abs, as well as specific exercise focused workout plan like you want to improve the number of pushups you can do. in all its exercises, it will track reps and posture. for workouts that do not have reps, rather use a timer/duration like a plank or a squat hold, it would focus more on timer and posture.

How I envision it is that once the exercise session starts, the workout plan will display very small at the bottom of the screen. The device will declare the workout and give the user a few seconds to prepare and declare the reps and maximum timer. Then the workout will start, and track the reps and posture, making sure they are doing it correctly. For now I need to mainly focus on the pose estimation and rep count
